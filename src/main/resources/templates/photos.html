        { id: 2, title: "Statuette of a Falcon", shortDesc: "This gilt bronze votive statuette of a hawk was discovered in...", image: "/images/StatuetteofFalcon.jpg", description: "This gilt bronze votive statuette of a hawk was discovered in 1893 at Sais(Sa- al - Hagar) in the western Delta and is dated to Dynasty 26. The statuette was made using the lost - wax technique in which a wax model was enclosed in clay and allowed to dry.The wax was then melted before the molten metal was poured into the resulting clay mould.Gold was used here to highlight the falcon’s head, plumage and jewellery.The statuette shows the avian form of god Horus, who was associated with kingship, wearing a crown(now partly broken) and a broad gilded collar ending in a solar - heart amulet.This amulet was probably used by ancient Egyptian kings as an attribute of god Horus, therefore, indicating the divine status of the king.The solar disk above the heart identified the king’s heart with the sun and may have signalled his ability to maintain maat(justice) in the same way the sun illuminated the universe.Such votive statuettes were donated to the temple to honour its deities.The gilded dedicatory text on the base of the statuette names a certain Imhotep, son of Padineith.By naming the dedicant in the inscription, he could magically participate in the daily temple rituals that common people were not allowed to attend", period: "Hellenistic Period (c. 200 BCE)", origin: "Athens, Greece" },

It was found placed over the head and shoulders of Tutankhamun’s mummified remains.  The king is made to look like the god Osiris, ruler of the underworld, and the sun god Re whose body was made of gold and hair of lapis lazuli. At the same time, this is a perfect version of Tutankhamun’s face, recognisable from his coffins, statues and temple reliefs. An inscription on the back provides further protection by identifying parts of the mask with different gods ‘Your forehead is Anubis, your right eye is the night boat (of Re), your left eye is the day boat, your eyebrows are in the company of nine gods’.", period: "Qin Dynasty (c. 210 BCE)", origin: "Xi'an, China" },

It is made of wood covered with sheets of gold that are both chased (pattern pressed into the metal) and inlaid with glass, faience and semi-precious stones. Side panels are formed from winged uraeus snakes holding the king’s cartouche. The scene on the front of backrest shows the king and queen under a floral canopy pierced by the rays of the Aten sun disk. Although adult-sized, this armchair must date from the beginning of Tutankhamun’s reign.", period: "Classic Period (c. 600 CE)", origin: "Palenque, Mexico" },

Through the quarrying and fashioning of these gigantic monoliths, the ancient Egyptians showed veneration to their divinised rulers. Royal colossi possibly also played the role of active intermediaries between mankind and the gods. Stand at the feet of awe-inspiring royal colossi in the Grand Hall, a dramatic space where visitors are first welcomed before they begin their tour to the Grand Egyptian Museum.", period: "Roman Empire (c. 100 BCE)", origin: "Pompeii, Italy" },

The statue shows him sitting in the traditional pose of an Egyptian scribe with his legs crossed and a roll of papyrus partly unrolled on his lap. He wears a short kilt and a broad collar. His thoughtful face is framed by short hair and he has magnetic eyes made with inlaid stone. Mitri’s name and titles are written on the statue base. Some of his titles include 'Nome Administrator', 'Priest of the goddess Maat' and 'Overseer of Scribes'.", period: "Viking Age (c. 900 CE)", origin: "Oslo, Norway" }
