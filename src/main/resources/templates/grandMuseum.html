            <div class="text">
                <p>In January of 2002, the Egyptian government announced a worldwide competition for the design of a new museum complex to
                    house, display, and preserve some of the world’s greatest ancient treasures with which the modern country of Egypt has
                    the privilege of being entrusted.

                    The following month, a ceremonial foundation stone was laid at the site selected for the new project, a site only two
                    kilometers away from Egypt’s greatest monuments and the only remaining wonder of the ancient world – the Pyramids of
                    Giza.

                    In 2003, the winner of the architectural design competition was announced at a press conference in Cairo, with the Irish
                    firm Heneghan Peng Architects securing the contract to turn their ultra-modern concept into the new Grand Egyptian
                    Museum.

                    Construction on the new museum began in earnest in 2005, but setbacks of environmental, financial, and political natures
                    soon beset the ambitious project and monumental delays ensued.

                    As the outbreak of the Arab Spring reached Egypt in early 2011, work on the project ground to a halt as the country
                    experienced several years of unfortunate political instability and uncertainty. Tourism to Egypt also dwindled during
                    these years, drying up the government’s coffers and jeopardizing the grand new museum’s future.

                    But following the restabilization of the government in 2014 and the preservation of that stability ever since, the
                    project soon got back on track and construction resumed with the help of international loans to cover the financial
                    shortfalls caused by the lingering effects of the tourism downturn.

                    When the Grand Egyptian Museum fully opens to the public in mid-2024 (estimated), it will be the largest archaeological
                    museum complex in the world and host to more than 100,000 artifacts. For the first time ever, King Tut’s entire treasure
                    collection will be on display alongside artifacts from pre-historic times through Egypt’s many thousands of years of
                    pharaonic civilization through the [comparatively] more modern ancient Greek and Roman periods of Egyptian history.

                    While the Egyptian government has previously announced that the GEM will open its doors to the general public in 2018
                    and again in 2019, we cautioned at the time that those opening dates were very likely to change. Now, however, we
                    believe that the mid-2024 target is likely to be met.</p>

      { id: 2, title: "Statuette of a Falcon", shortDesc: "This gilt bronze votive statuette of a hawk was discovered in...", image: "/images/StatuetteofFalcon.jpg", description: "This gilt bronze votive statuette of a hawk was discovered in 1893 at Sais(Sa- al - Hagar) in the western Delta and is dated to Dynasty 26. The statuette was made using the lost - wax technique in which a wax model was enclosed in clay and allowed to dry.The wax was then melted before the molten metal was poured into the resulting clay mould.Gold was used here to highlight the falcon’s head, plumage and jewellery.The statuette shows the avian form of god Horus, who was associated with kingship, wearing a crown(now partly broken) and a broad gilded collar ending in a solar - heart amulet.This amulet was probably used by ancient Egyptian kings as an attribute of god Horus, therefore, indicating the divine status of the king.The solar disk above the heart identified the king’s heart with the sun and may have signalled his ability to maintain maat(justice) in the same way the sun illuminated the universe.Such votive statuettes were donated to the temple to honour its deities.The gilded dedicatory text on the base of the statuette names a certain Imhotep, son of Padineith.By naming the dedicant in the inscription, he could magically participate in the daily temple rituals that common people were not allowed to attend", period: "Hellenistic Period (c. 200 BCE)", origin: "Athens, Greece" },

It was found placed over the head and shoulders of Tutankhamun’s mummified remains.  The king is made to look like the god Osiris, ruler of the underworld, and the sun god Re whose body was made of gold and hair of lapis lazuli. At the same time, this is a perfect version of Tutankhamun’s face, recognisable from his coffins, statues and temple reliefs. An inscription on the back provides further protection by identifying parts of the mask with different gods ‘Your forehead is Anubis, your right eye is the night boat (of Re), your left eye is the day boat, your eyebrows are in the company of nine gods’.", period: "Qin Dynasty (c. 210 BCE)", origin: "Xi'an, China" },

It is made of wood covered with sheets of gold that are both chased (pattern pressed into the metal) and inlaid with glass, faience and semi-precious stones. Side panels are formed from winged uraeus snakes holding the king’s cartouche. The scene on the front of backrest shows the king and queen under a floral canopy pierced by the rays of the Aten sun disk. Although adult-sized, this armchair must date from the beginning of Tutankhamun’s reign.", period: "Classic Period (c. 600 CE)", origin: "Palenque, Mexico" },

Through the quarrying and fashioning of these gigantic monoliths, the ancient Egyptians showed veneration to their divinised rulers. Royal colossi possibly also played the role of active intermediaries between mankind and the gods.

The statue shows him sitting in the traditional pose of an Egyptian scribe with his legs crossed and a roll of papyrus partly unrolled on his lap. He wears a short kilt and a broad collar. His thoughtful face is framed by short hair and he has magnetic eyes made with inlaid stone. Mitri’s name and titles are written on the statue base. Some of his titles include 'Nome Administrator', 'Priest of the goddess Maat' and 'Overseer of Scribes'.", period: "Viking Age (c. 900 CE)", origin: "Oslo, Norway" }
